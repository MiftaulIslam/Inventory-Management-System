<img src="IMS.svg" alt="Probable Folder Structure">

Creating a well-organized folder structure in our ASP.NET Core project is essential for maintaining clean code, promoting separation of concerns, and making it easier for team members to navigate the project. The structure we provided follows the principles of Clean Architecture, which helps in organizing the project into distinct layers.

Here’s a detailed explanation of each part of the structure:

### Root Level

- **/**: The root directory of our project. This contains all the source code, configurations, and other resources needed for our application.

### src

The `src` folder contains all the source code of our application, divided into different layers following the principles of Clean Architecture.

#### Application Layer

- **Application**: This layer contains the application’s business logic. It is responsible for processing commands and queries, mapping data, and defining interfaces for application services.

  - **Commands**: Contains handlers for commands (part of the CQRS pattern). Commands are operations that change the state of the system, such as creating, updating, or deleting records.
    
    Example: `CreateOrderCommandHandler.cs`, `UpdateUserCommandHandler.cs`
  
  - **Queries**: Contains handlers for queries (part of the CQRS pattern). Queries are operations that read data without modifying it.
    
    Example: `GetOrderQueryHandler.cs`, `GetUserQueryHandler.cs`
  
  - **Interfaces**: Defines interfaces for application services that will be implemented in other layers.
    
    Example: `IOrderService.cs`, `IUserService.cs`
  
  - **Mapping**: Contains mapping profiles for tools like AutoMapper to map between domain entities and DTOs.
    
    Example: `OrderMappingProfile.cs`, `UserMappingProfile.cs`

#### Domain Layer

- **Domain**: This layer contains the core business logic and domain entities. It is independent of other layers and should not have dependencies on infrastructure or presentation.

  - **Entities**: Contains domain models/entities representing the core business objects.
    
    Example: `Order.cs`, `User.cs`
  
  - **Repositories**: Defines interfaces for repositories that will handle data access. Actual implementations will be in the Infrastructure layer.
    
    Example: `IOrderRepository.cs`, `IUserRepository.cs`
  
  - **Services**: Contains domain services that encapsulate business logic that doesn’t naturally fit within a single entity.
    
    Example: `OrderDomainService.cs`, `UserDomainService.cs`
  
  - **Exceptions**: Contains custom exceptions specific to the domain layer.
    
    Example: `OrderNotFoundException.cs`, `UserAlreadyExistsException.cs`

#### Infrastructure Layer

- **Infrastructure**: This layer contains the implementations of data access, external services, and other infrastructure concerns.

  - **Persistence**: Contains the database context and migrations for Entity Framework Core or other ORM tools.
    
    Example: `ApplicationDbContext.cs`, `20210710120000_InitialCreate.cs`
  
  - **Repositories**: Contains implementations of repository interfaces defined in the Domain layer.
    
    Example: `OrderRepository.cs`, `UserRepository.cs`
  
  - **Services**: Contains implementations of external services like email, payment gateways, etc.
    
    Example: `EmailService.cs`, `PaymentGatewayService.cs`
  
  - **Identity**: Contains authentication and authorization logic, typically using ASP.NET Core Identity.
    
    Example: `ApplicationUser.cs`, `IdentityService.cs`
  
  - **Logging**: Contains configurations for logging frameworks like Serilog, NLog, etc.
    
    Example: `LoggingService.cs`
  
  - **Extensions**: Contains extension methods for various purposes, such as extending IServiceCollection for dependency injection.
    
    Example: `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`

#### Presentation Layer (Web API)

- **Presentation**: This layer contains the presentation logic, including API controllers, filters, and view models. It handles user interaction and returns responses.

  - **Controllers**: Contains API controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses.
    
    Example: `OrderController.cs`, `UserController.cs`
  
  - **Filters**: Contains action filters for cross-cutting concerns like logging, validation, and exception handling.
    
    Example: `LoggingFilter.cs`, `ValidationFilter.cs`
  
  - **Models**: Contains DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and view models used in API requests and responses.
    
    Example: `OrderDto.cs`, `UserDto.cs`
  
  - **Startup**: Contains configuration settings and service registrations (e.g., `Startup.cs`).
    
    Example: `Startup.cs`
  
  - **Extensions**: Contains extension methods for IServiceCollection, IApplicationBuilder, etc., to keep Startup.cs clean and modular.
    
    Example: `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`

#### Tests

- **Tests**: Contains unit tests, integration tests, and other types of tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of our application.

  Example: `OrderServiceTests.cs`, `UserRepositoryTests.cs`

### wwwroot

- **wwwroot**: This folder is typically used in ASP.NET Core MVC or Razor Pages applications to store static files such as images, CSS, JavaScript, etc. If applicable to our Web API, this is where we would place static assets.

By organizing our project in this way, we achieve several benefits:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a clear responsibility, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- **Scalability**: New features can be added with minimal impact on existing code.
- **Testability**: With clear boundaries between layers, unit tests and integration tests can be written more effectively.
- **Maintainability**: The structure promotes clean code practices, making it easier for team members to navigate and contribute to the project.

This folder structure is a guideline and can be adjusted based on our specific project requirements and team preferences.
